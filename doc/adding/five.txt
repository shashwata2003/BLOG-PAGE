context api:state management tool so when we login we want the user information.

So now we need figure out how to use the login page. So in a login page we have three function
i) fetching the data 
ii) error when the data doesnot match form the db
iii) success message when the data match the db.

so to do this we need a api called the context api whic does this task one by one

hence create a folder called the context 
inside that create three js files called the Context.js Reducer.js and the Actions.js 

the Context.js file contant the initial state of the login page and the it helps to create the context intially.

the Actions.js file contains all the actions that are done by this api and the Reducer connects both of this pages.

the Contect contains the the initail conditions of teh login page like:

const INITIAL_STATE ={
    user:null,
    isFetching:false,
    error:false
};

the detail of the context api is in the vedio:
