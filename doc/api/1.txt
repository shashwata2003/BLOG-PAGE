So day one we started to make this blog page api in which we can add delete write and edit blog pages, with spsific user id and password.

So first start by downloading the following modules:
express,dotenv(for proction of password in the database),mongooseand multer.

and then run the command init npm to run the node server. also install nodemon for live server reading.

now create a index.js file in which call the modules like:

const express=require("express");
const app=express();
const dotenv=require("dotenv");
const mongoose=require("mongoose");

now list a port no. to listen the server in the browser like:

app.listen("3000",()=>{
    console.log("running");
})


nowto encrypt our database we need to create a .env file in which we will create a variable called the MONGO_URL which will store the url of your database which we need to keep private.
like:

MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://Shashwata2003:Shashwata2003@cluster0.k3gqf0w.mongodb.net/blog?retryWrites=true&w=majority

next in the index.js firl call the dotenv file to using require and the run the config property of dotenv like:

dotenv.config();


Not to run the mongoose we will copy the following lines of code form the documention of mongoose like:

mongoose.set("strictQuery", false);
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL, () => {
  console.log("Connected to MongoDB");
}).then(console.log("Connected")).catch(err=>console.log(e));
